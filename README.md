# ArtMap-Helper

ArtMap is a Minecraft server plugin that allows players to paint on 32x32 canvases, with a restricted colour pallette (50, with 4 varients of each colour).

This tool takes an image (image.png), and outputs a 32x32 (aspect ratio is maintained, so image might not always be 32x32, but will definitly be 32x[something]) image that conforms to the colour restrictions.

# Usage
1. Have the input image in the working directory named `"image.png"`
2. Run `main.py`
3. The output image will be named `preview.png`
