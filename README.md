# ArtMap-Helper

ArtMap is a Minecraft server plugin that allows players to paint on 32x32 canvases, with a restricted colour pallette (50, with 4 varients of each colour).

This tool takes an image (image.png), and outputs a 32x32 (aspect ratio is maintained, so image might not always be 32x32, but will definitly be 32x[something]) image that conforms to the colour restrictions.
