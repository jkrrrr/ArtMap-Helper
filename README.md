# ArtMap-Helper

ArtMap is a Minecraft server plugin that allows players to paint on 32x32 canvases, with a restricted colour pallette (50, with 4 varients of each colour).

This tool takes an image, and outputs a 32x32 (aspect ratio is maintained, so image might not always be 32x32, but it will always fit in a 32x32 box) image that conforms to the colour restrictions.

# Usage

1. Select the file using the button "Select image from file"
2. Convert the image into an artmap with the button "Calculate ArtMap"
3. Save the image to a file with the button at the bottom labelled "Save to file"
