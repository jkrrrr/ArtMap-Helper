# ArtMap-Helper

ArtMap is a Minecraft server plugin that allows players to paint on 32x32 canvases, with a restricted colour pallette (50, with 4 varients of each colour).

This tool takes an image, and outputs a 32x32 (aspect ratio is maintained, so image might not always be 32x32, but it will always fit in a 32x32 box) image that conforms to the colour restrictions.

# Important

Colours are stored as an Excel database, so the application will not work without one. The default ArtMap can be found with the .exe in the releases page, and can be of course modified as you wish, as long as you follow the correct format (which can be found through examples in the spreadsheet).

Simply put the spreadsheet in the same directory as the .exe in order to use it.

# Usage

1. Select the file using the button "Select image from file"
2. Convert the image into an artmap with the button "Calculate ArtMap"
3. Save the image to a file with the button at the bottom labelled "Save to file"
